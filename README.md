## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Streamlit (Python web framework)
- **NLP Models**: Hugging Face Transformers
  - Summarization: `facebook/bart-large-cnn`
  - Question Answering: `distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad`
- **Text Processing**: 
  - PDF Extraction: `pdfminer.six`
  - Natural Language Processing: `nltk`
- **Document Handling**: Built-in Python libraries (`io`, `stringio`)

### Core Components

#### 1. Document Upload & Processing
```python
# PDF Processing
text = extract_text(uploaded_file)

# TXT Processing  
stringio = io.StringIO(uploaded_file.getvalue().decode("utf-8"))
text = stringio.read()
```

#### 2. Summarization Engine
```python
summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model="facebook/bart-large-cnn")
# Chunks text for processing, limits to 150 words
```

#### 3. Question Answering System
```python
qa_model = pipeline("question-answering", model="distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad")
# Uses document context to answer user questions
```

#### 4. Challenge Question Generator
```python
# Extracts key concepts from document sentences
# Generates contextual questions with document references
```
